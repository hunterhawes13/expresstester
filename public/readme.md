## Synopsis

Tool Shack Funhouse.

A tool created to save me time in preparing for DJ sets. Allows me to download new songs from charted mainstream sources as well as independent artists I am interested in. Features large buttons on top of page for easy navigation which switches the display between the Spotify and Soundcloud API calls. Conceptually the page is divided by nav buttons in the sky and songs in clouds. Songs have the ability to add to list that will store for future download at the bottom of the page. There is also a download button which will take you to the itunes store to purchase the song.

## Code Example

<!---Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.-->

## Motivation

This tool was created with the intention of only being used by me for the time being. However the ability to have other DJs use this time saving tool is possible by adding oAuth integration with the APIs. Contact me if this interests you.
